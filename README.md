# FAQ

### How do I find a structure?

Use `/locate structure joshie:sunken_spires/<structure name>`

### Can I use this on my server?

The structure uses vanilla blocks, so server owners can install the datapack and vanilla clients will be able to join fine.

### Can I use this in my modpack/video/world/server?

You are more than welcome to use Sunken Spires in any of these contexts.
